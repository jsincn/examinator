IMPORTANT
=========

Do *not* place binaries such as JPG, PNG, or PDF file here. Put them into the
pics directory instead.

Binaries placed here may be overwritten if the external TiKZ figures are
compiled, which would cause merge conflicts. This, binaries in this folder are
ignored by the TUMexam frontend during ZIP upload.
