TUMexam
=======

LaTeX template for exams. The most important things are documented below:


Dependencies
------------

In order to compile the template you need the following packages:
	texlive-full 2017-2020
	make

Tested under Linux (Debian) and macOS only.


Customization
-------------

Customizations such as department, chair, examiner, module number etc. are
made on the web interface of your instance and stored in 
conf/generated/examconf.tex. You should never change this file by hand.


Usage
-----

All problems should go into problems/, TikZ figures as standalone documents
named as $figure.tikz into figures/. For images such as JPEGs or PDFs create a
new subfolder pics/.

Do *not* create a subfolder named 'images'. This name is reserved for a symlink
created on TUMexam backends pointing to student images used for attendee lists.

All documents are compiled using 'make'. Enter 'make help' for a list of
targets.

Note that any PDF files not placed in the pics/ subfolder are ignored as it
could otherwise interfere with server-side builds.


Documentation
-------------

Build the template using `make`, a solution using `make solution`, and a
solution with correction notes using `make correction`. Read the resulting PDFs
and the corresponding LaTeX sources carefully. This should answer almost any
question.

If the build does not succeed, please make sure that you have an up to date
version of texlive-full installed and did not use any outdated version of
examconf.tex.

Windows users may consider using the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which
allows to install e.g. a Debian-based Linux container within Windows.


Known bugs:
-----------

- Compilation of seatplans and attendee lists obviously fails if not properly
  prepared.
